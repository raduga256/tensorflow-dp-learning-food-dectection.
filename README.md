A tensorflow learning journey and project development

## Research- Paper: Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests.
I re-implemented the paper using tensorflow and CNNs like VGG16, RestNet and EfficientNetB models to beat reported accuracy. Currently, researching on how to use mixed precision on GPUs to improve training time and accuracy.
